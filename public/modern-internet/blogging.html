				<h4>Blogging</h4>
                            	<p> Blogs have become an everyday part of online culture.
				Practically everyone reads blogs, whether they’re “official” news blogs associated with traditional news media,
				topic-based blogs related to one’s work or hobbies, or blogs purely for entertainment.
				But it wasn’t always so. According to analysts and online written articles, blogs have a relatively short history, even when 
				compared with the history of the Internet itself.And it’s only in the past five to ten years that they’ve really 
				taken off and become an important part of the online landscape.</p>
 
				<p>It’s generally recognized that the first blog was Links.net, created by Justin Hall, while he was a Swarthmore College student in 1994.
				 Of course, at that time they weren’t called blogs, and he just referred to it as his personal homepage.
				 It wasn’t until 1997 that the term “weblog” was coined. The word’s creation has been attributed to Jorn Barger,
				 of the influential early blog Robot Wisdom. The term was created to reflect the process of “logging the web” as he browsed.
				1998 marks the first known instance of a blog on a traditional news site, when Jonathan Dube blogged Hurricane Bonnie for The Charlotte Observer.
				“Weblog” was shortened to “blog” in 1999 by programmer Peter Merholz. It’s not until five years later that Merriam-Webster declares the word 
				their word of the year.The original blogs were updated manually, often linked from a central home page or archive. This wasn’t very efficient,
				 but unless you were a programmer who could create your own custom blogging platform, there weren’t any other options to begin with.</p>

				<p>The early 2000s were a period of growth for blogs. In 1999, according to a list compiled by Jesse James Garrett, 
				there were 23 blogs on the internet. By the middle of 2006, there were 50 million blogs according to Technorati‘s State of the Blogosphere report. 
				By 2001, there was enough interest in blogging that some how-to articles and guides started cropping up. Now, “meta blogs” (blogs about blogging)
				make up a sizable portion of the most popular and successful blogs out there.A number of popular blogs got their start in the early 2000s, 
				including Boing Boing, Dooce, Gizmodo, Gawker (the first major gossip blog to launch), Wonkette, and the Huffington Post. Weblogs, Inc. was started by 
				Jason Calacanis in 2003, and was then sold to AOL for $25 million. Audioblogger, the first major podcasting service, was founded in 2003. The first video blogs 				started in 2004, more than a year before YouTube was founded.Also launched in 2003 was the AdSense advertising platform, which was the first 
				ad network to match ads to the content on a blog. </p>

				<p>By the mid-2000s, blogs were reaching the mainstream. In January of 2005, a study was released saying that 32 million Americans read blogs. 
				At the time, it’s more than ten percent of the entire population. The same year, Garrett M. Graff was granted White House press credentials, 
				the first blogger ever to do so.Mainstream media sources are also teaming up with existing blogs and bloggers, rather than just setting out on their own.
