Email, or electronic mail, is the most common method of exchanging digital messages and remains one of the most popular services currently available via
the Internet, with over 90% of US Internet users actively using email. Here you’ll find an overview of the modern email system and infrastructure, as well 
as its origin and use. Email systems consist of computer servers that process and store messages on behalf of users who connect to the email infrastructure 
via an email client or web interface.When someone sends an email, the message is transferred from his or her computer to the server associated with the
recipient’s address, usually via a number of other servers.

Email was actually invented before the Internet itself, and was a crucial tool in the development of an interoperable computer network. Email is believed 
to have originated at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 1965 to allow users of a local time-sharing mainframe computer to communicate with
each other.This quickly evolved to systems that could communicate with other, compatible systems, and from 1969 the ARPANET computer network of the United 
States Department of Defense experimented with inter-system email transfers using the now familiar “@” sign to separate usernames from machine names. 
From the early 1980s networked personal computers on Local Area Networks also started supporting simple email systems.

When ARPANET later evolved into what we now know as the Internet, email was already the standard method of communication.Email servers are responsible for 
receiving, storing, forwarding, and delivering messages to and from email users. Messages are exchanged between servers using the SMTP protocol with various 
MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents) such as Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, or Exim. Messages can be stored on the server for the user to access, they can be downloaded
and stored in the email client for offline use, or stored both places.

When an email server accepts a message it is obliged to deliver it, or otherwise return a delivery failure message to the sender. 
This ensures that an email message cannot disappear into thin air and implies that the sender of an email can trust the integrity of the email system.
Occasionally a message can be neither delivered nor returned, usually as a result of a spam message to a non-existent recipient from a falsified sender 
address (see Anti-spam Info for more information).
