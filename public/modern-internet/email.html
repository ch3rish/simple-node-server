				<h4>How Email Works</h4>
        			
				<p> Email, or electronic mail, is the most common method of exchanging digital messages and remains one of the most popular services currently available via 
				the 	Internet, with over 90% of US Internet users actively using email. Here you’ll find an overview of the modern email system and infrastructure, as well as its
				origin and use.Email systems consist of computer servers that process and store messages on behalf of users who connect to the email infrastructure via an email 
				client or web interface.When someone sends an email, the message is transferred from his or her computer to the server associated with the recipient’s address, 
				usually via a number of other servers.</p>

				<p> Email was actually invented before the Internet itself, and was a crucial tool in the development of an interoperable computer network. Email is believed to 
				have originated at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 1965 to allow users of a local time-sharing mainframe computer to communicate with each other.This 
				quickly evolved to systems that could communicate with other, compatible systems, and from 1969 the ARPANET computer network of the United States Department of 
				Defense experimented with inter-system email transfers using the now familiar “@” sign to separate usernames from machine names. From the early 1980s networked 
				personal computers on Local Area Networks also started supporting simple email systems.</p>

				<p> Email servers are responsible for receiving, storing, forwarding, and delivering messages to and from email users. Messages are exchanged between servers 
				using the SMTP protocol with various MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents) such as Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, or Exim. Messages can be stored on 
				the server for the user to access, they can be downloaded and stored in the email client for offline use, or stored both places.When 
				an email server accepts a message it is obliged to deliver it, or otherwise return a delivery failure message to the sender. This ensures 
				that an email message cannot disappear into thin air and implies that the sender of an email can trust the integrity of the email system.
				Occasionally a message can be neither delivered nor returned, usually as a result of a spam message to a non-existent recipient from a falsified sender address 
				(see Anti-spam Info for more information).</p>

				<p> There are 3 main types of email servers. One is the SMTP servers: A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol server can refer to either a physical computer or a Mail 	
				Transfer Agent (MTA), which is a software program running on the machine. The MTA receives and delivers messages to and from other email servers, and from email 
				users (also known as “relaying”).The second is the POP servers: A Post Office Protocol server is a piece of software that gives an email user access to the email 
				stored in the user’s account on that server. The user can download the messages using a MUA (email client) and store the email locally for later viewing.An the last 
				is IMAP servers: An Internet Message Access Protocol server is a software program running on a server that provides full access to all the folders the user has 
				created on the server. The email user can synchronize all the folders and messages on the server with the data stored locally using a MUA with IMAP capabilities.</p>
