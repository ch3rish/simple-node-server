				<h4>Video Streaming</h4>
        			<p> Streaming video and audio have come a long way since then. According to ratings, 57 million people listen to Internet radio 
				every week. In 2006, people watched more than a million streaming videos a day on YouTube [source: Reuters]. The same year, 
				television network ABC started streaming its most popular TV shows over the Web. People who missed an episode of shows like 
				"The Voice" or "Game of Thrones" or any other trending series could catch up on the entire thing online -- legally and for free.</p>


				<p>In streaming video and audio, the traveling information is a stream of data from a server. The decoder is a stand-alone player 
				or a plugin that works as part of a Web browser. The server, information stream and decoder work together to let people watch live or
				prerecorded broadcasts.In this article, we'll explore what it takes to create this stream of ones and zeros as well as how it differs
				from the data in a typical download.</p>


				<p>The Internet is a way to connect our computer to other computers around the world, in order to share information in the form of e-mail, 
				Web pages, music, video, pictures, etc. The connection to other computers is not a direct connection, however; before your information can
				reach other people's machines, it must make a series of jumps from computer to computer as it traces a successful route. </p>

				<p>Packet servers,the big, powerful computers that form the backbone of the Internet, transmit information along in the form of distinct 
				packets of data.Furthermore, each packet you send over the Internet has the potential to take an entirely different route (i.e., jump through a different
				series of computers) than the packets that come before and after it . This is a built-in design feature of the Internet that allows information 
				to flow around heavy traffic areas and broken-down links in the chain. It works very well when downloading Web pages, where it doesn't matter 
				too much if the packets are mixed up, routed through a number of servers and arrive at different times. The various parts of a Web page do not 
				need to arrive at your computer in any particular sequential or chronological order. Video is a different story however.</p>

				<p>An important piece of the Internet puzzle is the language that the computers hooked up to one another use to communicate.
				 This machine language, or protocol, must be standardized and efficient to the task at hand.The protocol that's ordinarily used to deliver Web
				 content is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (abbreviated HTTP). The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) specifically handles streaming video content. 
				Both of these protocols can be used to deliver streaming video content..</p>
