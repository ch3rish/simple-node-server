				<h4>Overview</h4>
        			
				
				<p>The modern Internet began as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) funded experiment to interconnect 
				DoD-funded research sites in the U.S. The 1967 ACM meeting was also where the initial design for the so-called ARPANET — named 
				for the DoD's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) — was first published by Larry Roberts. In December 1968, ARPA awarded a 
				contract to Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) to design and deploy a packet switching network with a proposed line speed of 50 kbps.
				In September 1969, the first node of the ARPANET was installed at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), followed 
				monthly with nodes at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University 
				of Utah. With four nodes by the end of 1969, the ARPANET spanned the continental U.S. by 1971 and had connections to Europe by 1973.</p>

				</p>In Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Pocket Books, 1979), the hitchhiker describes outer space as being 
				"...big. Really big. ...vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big..." A similar description can be applied to the Internet. To paraphrase 
				the hitchhiker, you may think that your 750 node LAN is big, but that's just peanuts compared to the Internet.</p>

				<p>The ARPANET started with four nodes in 1969 and grew to just under 600 nodes before it was split in 1983. The NSFNET also started with 
				a modest number of sites in 1986. After that, the network experienced literally exponential growth. Internet growth between 1981 and 
				1991 is documented in "Internet Growth (1981-1991)" (RFC 1296).</p>Thirty years ago in 1985, the Internet was in its infancy. Apple's 
				personal computer, the Macintosh, had only been on the market for a year, and the online service that eventually became AOL was 
				readying its launch. It was during this time, on March 15th, that the first second-level dot com domain, symbolics.com, was introduced 
				online, marking the beginning of the modern Internet.</p>		

				<p>Today, the Internet helps connect around 3 billion people. This rapid pace of growth is expected to increase, particularly 
				in developing countries where growth rates continue to be three times as high [PDF, 1.7 MB] as those in developed countries.</p>
