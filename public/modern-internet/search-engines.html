				<h4>How Search Engines Work</h4>
        			<p>Modern search engines are pretty incredible – complex algorithms enable search engines to take your 
				search query and return results that are usually quite 	accurate, presenting you with valuable information nuggets
				amidst a vast information data mine.Search engines have come a long way since their early prototypes, as our Internet
				Search Engines History infographic illustrates. From improvements in web crawlers and categorizing and indexing the web,
				to introducing new protocols such as robots.txt so that webmasters have control what web pages get crawled, the development
				of search engines has been the culmination of multiple search technologies that developed from different search engines. Alta
				Vista was the first search engine to process natural language queries; Lycos started strong with a system categorizing 
				relevance signals, matching keywords with prefixes and word proximity; and Ask Jeeves introduced the use of human editors 
				to match actual user search queries</p>

				<p>A search engine is a program that searches the web for sites based on your keyword search terms. The search engine takes your
				keyword and returns search engine results pages (SERP), with a list of sites it deems relevant or connected to your searched keyword.
				The goal for many sites is to appear in the first SERP for the most popular keywords related to their business. A site's keyword ranking
				is very important because the higher a site ranks in the SERP, the more people will see it.SEO, or search engine optimization, is the 
				method used to increase the likelihood of obtaining a first page ranking through techniques such as link building, SEO title tags, content 
				optimization, meta description, and keyword research.Google search engines and other major search engines like Bing and Yahoo use large, 
				numerous computers in order to search through the large quantities of data across the web.</p>

				<p> Web search engines catalog the world wide web by using a spider, or web crawler. These web-crawling robots were created for indexing 
				content; they scan and assess the content on site pages and information archives across the web.Different internet search engines use different
				algorithms for determining which web pages are the most relevant for a particular search engine keyword, and which web pages should appear
				at the top of the search engine results page.Relevancy is the key for online search engines – users naturally prefer a search engine that 
				will give them the best and most relevant results.Search engines are often quite guarded with their search algorithms, since their unique
				algorithm is trying to generate the most relevant results. The best search engines, and often the most popular search engines as a result,
				are the ones that are the most relevant.</p>

				<p>Search engine history all started in 1990 with Archie, an FTP site hosting an index of downloadable directory listings. Search engines
				 continued to be primitive directory listings, until search engines developed to crawling and indexing websites, eventually creating algorithms
				 to optimize relevancy. Yahoo started off as just a list of favorite websites, eventually growing large enough to become a searchable index directory.
				 They actually had their search services outsourced until 2002, when they started to really work on their search engine. </p>
