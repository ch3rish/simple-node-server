				<h4>Current Network Protocols</h4>
        			
				<p> Prior to the 1960s, what little computer communication existed comprised simple text and binary data, carried 
				by the most common telecommunications network technology of the day; namely, circuit switching, the technology of 
				the telephone networks for nearly a hundred years. Because most data traffic is bursty in nature 					
				circuit switching results in highly inefficient use of network resources.The fundamental technology that makes the 
				Internet work is called packet switching, a data network in which all components (i.e., hosts and switches) operate 
				independently, eliminating single point-of-failure problems. In addition, network communication 					
				resources appear to be dedicated to individual users but, in fact, statistical multiplexing and an upper limit on the size 
				of a transmitted entity result in fast, economical networks.</p>

				<p>In the 1960s, packet switching was ready to be discovered. In 1961, Leonard Kleinrock of MIT published the first paper on 
				packet switching theory (and the first book on the subject in 1964). In 1962, Paul Baran of the Rand Corporation described a 
				robust, efficient, store-and-forward data network in a report for the U.S. Air Force. At about the same time, Donald Davies and 
				Roger Scantlebury suggested a similar idea from work at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the U.K. The research at MIT 
				(1961-1967), RAND (1962-1965), and NPL (1964-1967) occurred independently and the principal researchers did not all meet together
				 until the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) meeting in 1967. The term packet was adopted from the work at NPL.</p>

				<p>The modern Internet began as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) funded experiment to interconnect DoD-funded research sites in 
				the U.S. The 1967 ACM meeting was also where the initial design for the so-called ARPANET — named for the DoD's Advanced Research 
				Projects Agency (ARPA) — was first published by Larry Roberts. In December 1968, ARPA awarded a contract to Bolt Beranek and Newman
				 (BBN) to design and deploy a packet switching network with a proposed line speed of 50 kbps. In September 1969, the first node of 
				the ARPANET was installed at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), followed monthly with nodes at Stanford Research 
				Institute (SRI), the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah. With four nodes by the end of 1969, 
				the ARPANET spanned the continental U.S. by 1971 and had connections to Europe by 1973.</p>

				<p>The original ARPANET gave life to a number of protocols that were new to packet switching. One of the most lasting results of the 
				ARPANET was the development of a user-network protocol that has become the standard interface between users and packet switched networks; 
				namely, ITU-T (formerly CCITT) Recommendation X.25. This "standard" interface encouraged BBN to start Telenet, a commercial packet-switched 
				data service, in 1974; after much renaming, Telenet became a part of Sprint's X.25 service. </p>

				<p>The initial host-to-host communications protocol introduced in the ARPANET was called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). 
				Over time, however, NCP proved to be incapable of keeping up with the growing network traffic load. In 1974, a new, more robust suite of 
				communications protocols was proposed and implemented throughout the ARPANET, based upon the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for 
				end-to-end network communication. But it seemed like overkill for the intermediate gateways (what we would today call routers) 
				to needlessly have to deal with an end-to-end protocol so in 1978 a new design split responsibilities between a pair of protocols; the new 
				Internet Protocol (IP) for routing packets and device-to-device communication (i.e., host-to-gateway or gateway-to-gateway) and TCP 
				for reliable, end-to-end host communication. Since TCP and IP were originally envisioned functionally as a single protocol, the protocol 
				suite, which actually refers to a large collection of protocols and applications, is usually referred to simply as TCP/IP.</p>
