				<h4>Microblogging and Social Networking</h4>
                            	<p> A lot of people only think of Twitter when they think of microblogging, but there are other microblog (also called tumblog) platforms that allow for a more 				traditional type of blogging experience, while also allowing for the social networking features of Twitter (like following other bloggers).
				Tumblr was the first major site to offer this kind of service, starting in 2007. They allow for a variety of different post types, unlike traditional blogging 					services, which have a one-size-fits-all post format (that allows users to format their posts however they want, including adding multimedia objects).
				It also makes it easier for users to reblog the content of others, or to like individual posts (sort of like Facebook’s “like” feature).
				Posterous is another, similar service. Launched in 2008, Posterous allows bloggers to set up a simple blog via email, and then submit content
				either via their online editor or by email.Posterous is sometimes considered more of a lifestreaming app than a blogging platform, thought it’s technically both.</p>
 
				
				<p>Microblogging is a broadcast medium that exists in the form of blogging. A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically smaller in
				both actual and aggregated file size. Microblogs "allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links", 
				which may be the major reason for their popularity.These small messages are sometimes called microposts. Commercial microblogs also exist to promote websites, 
				services and products, and to promote collaboration within an organization.Some microblogging services offer features such as privacy settings, which allow users to
				control who can read their microblogs, or alternative ways of publishing entries besides the web-based interface. These may include text messaging, instant
				messaging, E-mail, digital audio or digital video.Sometimes,users do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather
				that which projects a good impression of themselves.</p>

				<p> According to Boyd and Ellison's (2007) article, "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life", social 	
				networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to: construct a public/semi-public profile, articulate a list of other users that they 
				share a connection with, and view their list of connections within the system. The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of "friends" who are also 
				users of the site. In an article entitled "Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship," Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of 
				profiles as unique pages where one can "type oneself into being."[33] A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some 
				sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their 
				profile by adding modules or "Applications."Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of 
				contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls 
				that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.</p>

				<p>Many social networking services, such as Facebook, provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile.This goes the same as to any other social 
				networking sites like twitter and instagram. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized usersfrom accessing their information. To edit information on a certain social 	
				networking service account, the social networking sites require you to login or provide a password. This is deigned to prevent unauthorized users from adding, 	
				changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.
