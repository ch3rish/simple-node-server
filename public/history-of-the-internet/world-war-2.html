Communication in World War 2

The need for proficient and reliable radio communications peaked quickly during the World War II era, 1939-1945.  
With the new tactical developments from all aspects of the service (air, infantry, artillery, etc.), portable radios became a necessary 
standard issue for every level of the service.   Even tanks were equipped with at least one portable radio and some were 
known to have had as many as three.  With the introduction of high-powered telegraph communications, transmission was now 
possible up to 100 mile radius. With US troops spread throughout the various theaters of WWII, it also became necessary 
to establish long-range overseas communication.  Throughout the war, various means of improved communication and electronic 
devices would emerge greatly assisting all areas of the military.  Continual advancements in communications remained a priority
 throughout the war, not only for the United States, but for all the major forces involved in World War II.

During the Cold War, in 1957, when the Soviet Union
(Russia) was able to send to orbit Sputnik 1, an Intercontinental Nuclear Weapon.
The terror of electromagnetic pulse due to a nuclear fallout, rose and 
paved the way for the US military to develop a weapon, especially
a form of communication wherein messages from different camps or sites
could be efficiently sent without interferences and delays if in case there
would be a nuclear fallout.This was the main reason
 that sparked the idea of the technology, which then led to the creation
 of DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)by President Dwight Eisenhower; the defense military army of the United States
  especially assigned for developing new technologies for the safety  and protection of the country.
