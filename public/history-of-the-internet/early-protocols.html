								<h4>Use of Early Messaging Protocols</h4>
                            	<p>The birth of electronic mail (email) occurred in the early 1960s. The mailbox was a file in a user's home directory that was
								readable only by that user. Primitive mail applications appended new text messages to the bottom of the file, making the user 
								had to wade through the constantly growing file to find any particular message. This system was only capable of sending messages
								to users on the same system.</p> 
								<p> The first network transfer of an electronic mail message file took place in 1971 when a computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson sent
								a test message between two machines via ARPANET - the precursor to the Internet. Communication via email soon became very popular,
								comprising 75 percent of ARPANET's traffic in less than two years.Various forms of one-to-one electronic messaging were used in the 1960s. 
								People communicated with one another using systems developed for specific mainframe computers. As more computers were interconnected, 
								especially in the US Government's ARPANET, standards were developed to allow users of different systems to email one another.
								SMTP can trace its roots to two implementations described in 1971: the Mail Box Protocol and the SNDMSG program. Fewer than 50 hosts were 
								connected to the ARPANET at this time.</p>
								<p>Further implementations include FTP Mailand Mail Protocol, both from 1973.Development work continued 
								throughout the 1970s, until the ARPANET transitioned into the modern Internet around 1980. Jon Postel then proposed a Mail Transfer Protocol
								in 1980 that began to remove the mail's reliance on FTP.SMTP was published as RFC 788 in November 1981, also by Postel.
								Message submission (RFC 2476) and SMTP-AUTH (RFC 2554) were introduced in 1998 and 1999, both describing new trends in email delivery. 
								Originally, SMTP servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the organization from the outside, and relaying messages 
								from the organization to the outside. But as time went on, SMTP servers (mail transfer agents), in practice, were expanding their roles to become
								message submission agents for Mail user agents, some of which were now relaying mail from the outside of an organization. (e.g. a company executive wishes 
								to send email while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) Many people contributed to the core SMTP specifications, among them Jon Postel, Eric Allman,
								Dave Crocker, Ned Freed, Randall Gellens, John Klensin, and Keith Moore.</p>
