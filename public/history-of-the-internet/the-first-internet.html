								<h4>The First Network for Research</h4>
                            	
                            	<p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP. 
								Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. ARPANET was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, 
								formerly Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.</p> 
								
								<p> Packet switching was based on concepts and designs by Americans Leonard Kleinrock and Paul Baran, British scientist Donald Davies and Lawrence Roberts of
								the Lincoln Laboratory.The TCP/IP communication protocols were developed for ARPANET by computer scientists Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf, and incorporated
								concepts by Louis Pouzin for the French CYCLADES project.The earliest ideas for a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer
								users were formulated by computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), in April 1963, in memoranda discussing the concept 
								of the "Intergalactic Computer Network". Those ideas encompassed many of the features of the contemporary Internet.</p>
								
								<p>In October 1963, Licklider was appointed head of the Behavioral Sciences and Command and Control programs at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects 
								Agency (ARPA). He convinced Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor that this network concept was very important and merited development, although Licklider left ARPA before 
								any contracts were assigned for development.Sutherland and Taylor continued their interest in creating the network, in part, to allow ARPA-sponsored
								researchers at various corporate and academic locales to utilize computers provided by ARPA, and, in part, to quickly distribute new software and other
								computer science results.Taylor had three computer terminals in his office, each connected to separate computers, which ARPA was funding: 
								one for the System Development Corporation (SDC) Q-32 in Santa Monica, one for Project Genie at the University of California, Berkeley, and another
								for Multics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
								
								<p>Taylor recalls the circumstance: "For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets 
								of user commands. So, if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C., and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley, or M.I.T., about this, 
								I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said, "Oh Man!", it's obvious what to do:
								If you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That idea is the ARPANET". </p>
