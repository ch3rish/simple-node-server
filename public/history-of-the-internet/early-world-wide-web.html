								<h4>The First Internet for Public use</h4>
                            	<p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP. 
								Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. ARPANET was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, 
								formerly Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA) of the United States Department of DefenseIt was on 6 August 1991 when the World Wide Web became publicly available. 
								Its creator, the now internationally known Tim Berners-Lee, posted a short summary of the project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup and gave birth to a new technology
								which would fundamentally change the world as we knew it.On 6 August 1991, the World Wide Web went live to the world. There was no fanfare in the global press.
								In fact, most people around the world didn't even know what the Internet was. Even if they did, the revolution the Web ushered in was still but a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye. 
								Instead, the launch was marked by way of a short post from Berners-Lee on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, which is archived to this day on Google Groups.</p> 
								<p> The World Wide Web has its foundation in work that Berners-Lee did in the 1980s at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. He had been looking 
								for a way for physicists to share information around the world without all using the same types of hardware and software. This culminated 
								in his 1989 paper proposing "A large hypertext database with typed links".While the initial proposal failed to gain much momentum within CERN, it was later 
								expanded into a more concrete document proposing a World Wide Web of documents, connected via hypertext links. World Wide Web was adopted as the project's
								name following rejected possibilities such as "The Mine of Information" and "The Information Mesh". The May 1990 proposal described the concept of the Web as thus:
								HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. Potentially, HyperText provides
								a single user-interface to many large classes of stored information such as reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line systems help.
								We propose the implementation of a simple scheme to incorporate several different servers of machine-stored information already available at CERN, including 
								an analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments.</p>
								<p>In 1990, working on a computer built by NeXT, the firm Steve Jobs launched after being pushed out of Apple in the mid-80s, Berners-Lee developed the first 
								Web browser software called, fittingly, WorldWideWeb. By the end of that year he had a working prototype of the Web running on a server at CERN.
								The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.The project started with 
								the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, 
								and the dissemination of information by support groups.In 1993, it was announced by CERN that the World Wide Web was free for everyone to use and develop, 
								with no fees payable – a key factor in the transformational impact it would soon have on the world.</p>
								<p>While a number of browser applications were developed during the first two years of the Web, it was Mosaic which had the most impact. 
								It was launched in 1993 and by the end of that year was available for Unix, the Commodore Amiga, Windows and Mac OS. The first browser to be freely 
								available and accessible to the public, it inspired the birth of the first commercial browser, Netscape Navigator, while Mosaic’s technology went on to 
								form the basis of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. </p>
