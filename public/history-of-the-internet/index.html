During the Cold War, in 1957, when the Soviet Union
(Russia) was able to send to orbit Sputnik 1, an Intercontinental Nuclear Weapon.
The terror of electromagnetic pulse due to a nuclear fallout, rose and 
paved the way for the US military to develop a weapon, especially
a form of communication wherein messages from different camps or sites
could be efficiently sent without interferences and delays if in case there
would be a nuclear fallout.This was the main reason
 that sparked the idea of the technology, which then led to the creation
 of DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)by President Dwight Eisenhower; the defense military army of the United States especially assigned
for developing new technologies for the safety  and protection of the country.


The first network was called the ARPANET,which originated from DARPA to 
ARPA (Advance Regulatory Project Agency). The first Universities who 
participated on the use and execution of the first network were, Universities of California
(LA, and Santa Barbara) Masachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Utah, and SRI 
International.

In 1961,Len Kleinrock, Professor of Computer Science at UCLA, wrote the first paper 
on packet switching, "Information Flow in Large Communications Nets."In,1962 J.C.R.
 Licklider & W. Clark wrote first paper on Internet Concept, "On-Line Man Computer Communications."
