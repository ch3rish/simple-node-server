               <h1>How Security Tokens Work</h1>
               <h4>What are Security Tokens?</h4>    
              
          <p>A security token (sometimes called an authentication token) is a small hardware
          device that the owner carries to authorize access to a network service.<br>
           The device may be in the form of a smart card or may be embedded in a commonly used object such as a key fob. 
           Security tokens provide an extra level <br> of assurance through a method known as two-factor authentication: the user has
           a personal identification number (PIN), which authorizes them as the owner <br>of that particular device; the device then displays
           a number which uniquely identifies the user to the service, allowing them to log in.
           The identification number <br> for each user is changed frequently, usually every five minutes or so.</p>

               <h4>Where do we use security tokens?</h4>
               
              <p> Security tokens are used to prove one's identity electronically (as in the case of a customer trying to access their bank account).<br>
               The token is used in addition to or in place of a password to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. The token acts like an 
               electronic key to access something.</p>
               
               <p>Security tokens are commonly used by companies, banks, and people who would want to secure some important data, or perhaps 
               money, and other assets.</p>

                <p>Some may store cryptographic keys, such as a digital signature, or biometric data, such as fingerprint minutiae. Some designs
                feature tamper resistant packaging,<br> while others may include small keypads to allow entry of a PIN or a simple button to start a
                generating routine with some display capability to show a generated key number.<br> Special designs include a USB connector, RFID functions or 
                Bluetooth wireless interface to enable transfer of a generated key number sequence to a client system.</p>
                

                
                <h4>What is the difference between a password and a security token?</h4>
               
                <p>Unlike a password, a security token is a physical object. A key fob, for example, is practical and easy to carry, and thus, easy
                for the user to protect. Even if the key fob falls <br> into the wrong hands, however, it can't be used to gain access because the PIN 
                (which only the rightful user knows) is also needed.</p>
                
                <h4>What is a two-step authentication process?</h4>
                
                <p>Two-factor authentication is a security process in which the user provides two means of identification from separate categories
                of credentials; one is typically a physical token, <br> such as a card, and the other is typically something memorized, such as a security code.
               In this context, the two factors involved are sometimes spoken of as something you have <br>  and something you know. A common example of two-factor
               authentication is a bank card: the card itself is the physical item and the personal identification number (PIN) is the data <br>  that goes with it.
               Including those two elements makes it more difficult for someone to access the userâ€™s bank account because they would have to have the physical 
               item in their possession <br>and also know the PIN.</p>

                <p>According to proponents, two-factor authentication can drastically reduce the incidence of online identity theft, phishing
                expeditions, and other online fraud, because stealing <br>the victim's password is  not enough to give a thief access to their information.</p>
               
               <h4>MY PERSONAL ENCOUNTER ON SECURITY TOKENS</h4>

               <p> Last year, I was able to work at a telecommunications company for about two months and a half. I was AWOL because I left for school.
               It was a hard but a nice experience, though.</p>
               
               <p>It was within the period of the four-month vacation due to the transition of the 
               academic year in UP. I thought that since I wasn't able to attend summer classes, why not find a job atleast. <br>So there, I applied and got hired at 
               the company, as a Credit Management Specialist on the Credit Management Department. At first, I thought that when you work at a call center,
               all the work<br> would just be easy. In fact, my first impression on working there was that all I have to do is be a fluent english speaker, and atleast know
               some things about computer navigation. But I was wrong! <br>It was hard, and I always find my self in a whirlwind of confusion whenever I was at the floor. 
               Luckily we had a one-month training and I knew I have learned a lot. </p>
               
               <p>On the second week of our training, before our nesting period,I, together with mywavemates (we were hired at the same date and became like
               batchmates) were each given a security token. <BR>It was the same as the security token image above. Our trainor explained to us that we will be needing 
               our tokens to access our personal accounts in the company like our payslip, or like our account <BR> in logging in when it's time for calls. Ofcourse after she'd
               given that to us, we have already created a number of accounts which needed a lot of passwords. I remembered I needed <BR>to write them all down, my accounts 
               and my passwords because It was tricky to memorize them all.</p>
               
               <p> The security token was like a flash drive with a screen. It also looked like a little beeper, with a combination of numbers changing every minute.
               I was amazed the first time I got a hold onto it.<br> It was registered, I think, just for me at that moment. Every meeting of our training, our trainor would 
               give us our tokens, and we will return it to her before we go home. She did not let us bring them home; <br>tokens are really expensive.</p>
               
               <p>One time, I was able to borrow the token of one of my wavemates and tried to login on my account. I thought it was going to work but I wasn't able to get in.
               Also, about the changing combination of numbers, <br>you need to log in using the combinations within that short span of time or you  before it changes, or
               you would have to restart again if it did not recognize the combination. It was really tricky, but amazing.</p>
               
               <p> I think this type of technology, the security tokens,  is a good way of reducing theft and fraud in companies and in establishments
               or businesss that use them. I think one factor that security token are rarely used <br>in the Philippines, (or so I thought) is because they are expensive. </p>
