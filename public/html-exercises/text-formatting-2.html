<h1>This is Me </h1>
<p> I am <strong> Ma. Johnna Ver S. Valencia </strong>. Actually, I have a lot of nicknames given to me by my friends and my loved ones, but my favorite is 
<em> JABS </em>. 
I was born on the 15th of MARCH, 1995, in a small town called Roxas, in the province of Oriental Mindoro. I am the type of person who spends most of her 
time listening to music, so I guess that makes me very good in tones and pitches, and harmonizing second voices. Aside from that, I also love to read novels,
write scribbles and snippets, play guitar, and cook!</p> 
<hr>
<p> I went to Santo Nino School of Roxas, a Catholic High School in our town,and graduated last 2011. Now, I am currently a Senior student, taking up
Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, in the University of the Philippines Los Banos. As I have mentioned before, I love reading; it has been a part of me eversince.
I am an avid fan of love stories, so almost all of the books that I have read are about them. The last book that I have finished was <em> "The Statistical 
Probability of Love at First Sight" </em> by Jennifer Smith. It was a very good story, and it is now on my favorites list along with <em> "A Walk To Remember" </em> by Nicolas
Sparks, and <em> "If I Stay "</em> and <em> "Where She Went" </em> by Gayle Foreman. Of all the quotations that I've encountered and learned in school, my favorite is the quote from 
Theodore Roosevelt, given to us by my Professor in my accounting subject. It was printed on our exam questionaire during an exam. It says: "Believe 
you can, and you're halfway there." </p>
