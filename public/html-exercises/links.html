               <h3> JABS' Top Picks </h3>
               <em>I am certainly a movie addict; I watch movies from love stories to series to sci fis to action to thriller, even gore ones, 
               which makes it really hard for me to choose what is ultimately my favorite movie. I just can't choose one! Actually this saddens me 
               that I only get to pick my top three. For this one, I guess my criteria would be the movies that I was able to watch a million times! haha</em>
               <p> The third spot goes to the action packed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596343/"> Fast Five</a> Actually this movie is tied with 
               Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, but  I am a fangirl of the whole Fast and Furious Series than the Transformers Series. I loved FAST FIVE 
               because it was full of intense fast car scenes, and the cinematography is so cool that when you watch it along with a good set of surround sound
               speakers, you will actually feel you're in the movie. Morever, what amazed me was the story's twist, (oops spoiler alert!) 
               That is when they actually managed to steal all of the druglords money in the end, after ofcourse damaging first almost the entire city!</p>
               
                 <p> The second spot goes to the chick-flick romance comedy movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356470/"> A Cinderella Story </a> This is 
                 my all-time favorite modernized cinderella story. What I love most about this movie was the part when Austin and Sam danced on that very beautiful 
                 spot as the violin instrumental of the song "I'll Be" played magically on the background.</p>
                 
                 <p> The first spot goes to <a href=" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962726/"> High School Musical 3: Senior Year </a> I had to admit, I am a High
                 School Musical Series Fannatic! Everytime I want to just relax, I would watch the whole HSM movies from 1-3! But ofcourse, part 3 is my favorite!
                 Who would forget our Senior Year? If only I could be High School forever! haha, but nope, I'm just kidding! I could watch this movie over and over
                 again, like a kid watching Frozen for a million times, and never get tired of it! I even sing and dance to every single song! haha Cheers for ZAC 
                 EFRON'S awesomeness!</p>
