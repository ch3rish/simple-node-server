               <h3>The Story of My Life</h3>
               
              
               <p> I grew up in a small town in the province of Oriental Mindoro where the way of living of the people is very simple. 
          My father died of cardiac arrest when I was two, and that became a turning point of a lot of changes in our family back then. 
          I, together with my sister and three brothers, were raised by our mother alone. I grew up lacking a father figure to send me to 
          and fetch me at school,to play with me or carry me in his arms whenever I cry, however, my mother did all that for me and for my 
          siblings amazingly, that I, for all these years, never felt less loved and less cared for. Back then I remember,I was very fond of 
          reading story books, and my mom would always tell me that I was the kid who was always happy playing all by herself.</p>

               <p> Of all the chapters in my life, I can say that my high school life was the most colorful of it all. I was an achiever back 
               in high school;I graduated as the Valedictorian of our batch last 2011. I was also a student leader then, and a writer; well, 
               I am still a writer now. What I loved most about my high school life aside from my academic experiences, were the friends that 
               've had, and the experiences I've shared with them, the good and the bad. Most of my friends in High School were my elementary 
               classmates, and even though they weren't with me when I got to college, the strong bond we built in high school made us still 
               stick together up until now </p>

                <p>Right now, I am a Senior in UPLB, taking up a degree in Nutrition, striving hard to pass my subjects while at the same time 
                fighting for my rights to claim the subjects I should be getting for my last two semesters. I am currently in my midyear classes,
                enjoying this quite challenging but cool subject comsci 2. I am planning to apply for an online writing job in the mean time, 
                so that while waiting for the next school year, I could help my mom by raising some money for my tuition and other dues. </p>

               <p> We all have been told that no one can know what the future would look like, but we can always hope and dream for what we want.
               And the good thing about future is that it is one day at a time. As for me, I will be a successful Nutritionist Dietician in the 
               field that I'll choose. I will also be providing my family a small business, and probably a gift trip.Also, when the right time 
               comes, I would probably be meeting the man that I will spend the rest of my life with, and build a home and a family together. 
               The most important thing and the one thing I'd always hope for and look forward to the future where I would be happy, and would 
               feel at peace with all the things around me.  </p>
